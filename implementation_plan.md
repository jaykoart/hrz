# GEMINI Project Documentation Restructuring Plan

## Goal
To restructure the existing VPN and Cloud documentation into a unified "Earth AI" strategy for 2025-2027, incorporating the latest Dec 2025 market research and aligning with Korean government R&D trends.

## Proposed Structure

### 1. Central Hub (`GEMINI_Master.md`)
- **Purpose**: The entry point for the entire project.
- **Content**: High-level vision, directory structure, quick links to sub-strategies.
- **Changes**: Will serve as the root document, linking to the new unified strategy files.

### 2. Core Strategy (`Strategy_Earth_AI_Cloud.md`)
- **Purpose**: The "Why" and "How". Merges the "VPN" (User Acquisition/Grid) and "Cloud" (High Performance/Boutique) strategies.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **Earth VPN**: Eco-friendly distributed network.
    - **Wholefood AI**: The specific AI niche (Food/Agri/PropTech).
    - **Boutique Green Cloud**: Competitive edge against AWS/Lambda Labs.
- **Sources**: Based on `vpn-future.md` and `cloud/` files.

### 3. Executive Roadmap (`CEO_Plan_2026_2027.md`)
- **Purpose**: The "When". A concrete monthly/quarterly timeline.
- **Content**:
    - **Phase 1 (2025 Q4 - 2026 Q1)**: MVP & Seed Funding (Deep Tech/TIPS).
    - **Phase 2 (2026 Q2 - Q4)**: Market Entry & Series A.
    - **Phase 3 (2027+)**: Global Expansion & IPO Prep.
- **Data**: Incorporates the 35.3 Trillion Won Korea R&D budget timeline.

### 4. Market Intelligence (`Market_Research_2026.md`)
- **Purpose**: The "Evidence". Backing data for investors and internal decision making.
- **Content**:
    - Global Green Data Center trends.
    - Residential Proxy market size ($4.5B).
    - Competitor analysis (Hetzner, Lambda Labs).

## Verification
- **Review**: User to review the logic flow and strategic alignment.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure all dates and budget figures match the Dec 8, 2025 research data.
